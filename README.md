Tutorial exercise
Hello Everyone!

I'm a newbie and learning about GitHub by doing this hands-on exercise. 
I'm passionate about bitcoin and open source culture from an enduser's perspective since I'm not a developer.
In fact, I'm a recruiter who is here to learn as much as I'm here to share some cool OSS startup companies I represent.
I would like to learn more about your hobbies, interests and passions and perhaps I have a role with a startup that matches those passions.
